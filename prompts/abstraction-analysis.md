# Abstraction and Concept Analysis Prompt

## Objective
Analyze git diff changes to determine how they impact the number and quality of abstractions and concepts in the codebase. Produce a numerical score from **-5 to +5** that represents the change:
- **Negative scores (-5 to -1)**: Harmful changes (over-abstraction, unnecessary complexity, or concept bloat)
- **Zero (0)**: No significant change in abstraction level
- **Positive scores (+1 to +5)**: Beneficial changes (appropriate abstractions, concept clarity, reduced complexity)

## Context
You will be provided with:
1. Git diff output showing added/removed/modified lines
2. File paths and code structure
3. Programming language context

## Core Philosophy

**Good abstractions:**
- Solve real, recurring problems
- Hide complexity appropriately
- Have clear, focused responsibilities
- Make code more maintainable and understandable
- Follow the "Rule of Three" (abstract after 3rd duplication)

**Bad abstractions:**
- Premature optimization (abstracting before patterns emerge)
- Over-engineering (excessive layers, frameworks within frameworks)
- Leaky abstractions (implementation details bleeding through)
- Wrong abstractions (forced patterns that don't fit)

## Analysis Framework

### 1. New Concepts and Abstractions

#### Classes, Interfaces, Types
Count and evaluate:
- **New classes/interfaces**: Are they justified?
- **New type definitions**: Do they clarify or complicate?
- **Abstract classes/base classes**: Appropriate inheritance?
- **Traits/mixins/protocols**: Proper composition?

**Scoring guidance:**
- Well-named, focused class with clear responsibility: +1 point
- Appropriate interface/protocol defining contract: +1.5 points
- Abstract base class solving genuine duplication: +1 point
- Premature abstraction (only 1-2 uses): -2 points
- God class (too many responsibilities): -2 points
- Unnecessary wrapper class: -1 point
- Type alias improving clarity: +0.5 points

#### Functions and Methods
Evaluate new/modified functions:
- **Pure functions** (no side effects): Generally positive
- **Well-named functions** extracting complex logic: +1 point
- **Single responsibility**: Clear, focused purpose
- **Helper/utility functions**: Reduce duplication

**Scoring guidance:**
- Function extracting duplicated code (3+ occurrences): +1.5 points
- Function extracting complex logic with clear name: +1 point
- Premature function extraction (no duplication): -0.5 points

### 2. Design Patterns

#### Pattern Introduction
Identify design patterns added:
- **Strategy pattern**: Multiple algorithms/behaviors

### 3. Conceptual Complexity

#### Cognitive Load Assessment
Evaluate understandability:
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Branches and paths
- **Nesting levels**: Deep nesting is harder to understand
- **Function length**: Shorter is generally better

#### Duplication vs. Abstraction
Assess code duplication changes:
- **Duplication removed** through abstraction: Positive
- **Premature abstraction** (not yet duplicated): Negative
- **Inline duplication** (removed abstraction): Context-dependent

**Scoring guidance:**

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Structural Changes
Parse diff for:
- New classes, interfaces, types
- New functions, methods
- Modified signatures
- Deleted abstractions
- Renamed concepts

### Step 2: Categorize Changes
For each change, determine:
- Is it adding abstraction?
- Is it removing abstraction?
- Is it refining/improving abstraction?
- Is it introducing a pattern?
- Is it simplifying complexity?

### Step 3: Assess Appropriateness
For each abstraction change:
- Is it solving a real problem?
- Does it have 3+ use cases (Rule of Three)?
- Does it make code more understandable?
- Does it reduce or increase cognitive load?
- Is it premature or over-engineered?

### Step 4: Evaluate Naming and Clarity
- Are names clear and domain-appropriate?
- Do abstractions hide the right details?
- Are interfaces clean and focused?

### Step 5: Calculate Complexity Impact
- Did cyclomatic complexity increase/decrease?
- Are there more or fewer concepts to understand?
- Is the overall architecture clearer?

### Step 6: Apply Scoring Rubric
- Sum individual scores
- Weight by impact and scope
- Consider net effect on maintainability

### Step 7: Normalize to -5 to +5 Scale
- Cap at -5 (minimum)
- Cap at +5 (maximum)
- Round to nearest 0.5

### Step 8: Provide Justification
Include specific examples:
- What abstractions were added/removed?
- Why are they appropriate or problematic?
- Impact on code clarity and maintainability

## Example Analysis Output

```json
{
  "score": 2.5,
  "reasoning": "Introduced UserAuthentication strategy pattern to handle 3 different auth methods (OAuth, JWT, API key), replacing duplicated code across 5 files. Created clear AuthStrategy interface and 3 implementations. Extracted complex token validation into separate function. Overall, reduced complexity through appropriate abstraction.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Strategy pattern solves genuine duplication (5 locations)",
    "Clear interface with 3 concrete implementations",
    "Extracted complex validation logic with clear name",
    "Improved testability through dependency injection"
  ],
  "abstraction_changes": {
    "added": ["AuthStrategy interface", "OAuthStrategy class", "JWTStrategy class", "APIKeyStrategy class", "validateToken function"],
    "removed": ["duplicated auth code in 5 files"],
    "complexity_change": -15
  }
}
```

## Example of Over-Abstraction

```json
{
  "score": -3.5,
  "reasoning": "Added AbstractFactoryProviderBuilder with 4 inheritance levels for simple object creation used in only one place. Introduced generic DataProcessor<T, R, E> wrapper around basic transform function. Created unnecessary IUserServiceFactoryInterface for single implementation. Over-engineered for current needs.",
  "key_factors": [
    "4-level inheritance hierarchy for single use case",
    "Premature abstraction with no duplication",
    "Generic wrapper adding complexity without benefit",
    "Interface with only one implementation",
    "Names suggest over-thinking (AbstractFactoryProviderBuilder)"
  ],
  "abstraction_changes": {
    "added": ["AbstractFactoryProviderBuilder", "DataProcessor<T,R,E> generic", "IUserServiceFactoryInterface", "3 intermediate abstract classes"],
    "removed": [],
    "complexity_change": +25
  }
}
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Context is critical**: An abstraction might be premature now but correct in larger context
2. **Rule of Three**: Generally don't abstract until pattern appears 3 times
3. **Locality of behavior**: Good abstractions keep related code together
4. **Wrong abstraction**: Worse than duplication; harder to fix later
5. **Team size and skill**: More abstractions may be appropriate for larger, experienced teams
6. **Domain complexity**: Complex domains benefit from rich domain models

## Common Patterns

### High Positive Score (+4 to +5)
- Major refactoring removing duplication through clear abstractions
- Appropriate design pattern solving recurring problem
- Clear domain modeling improving code clarity
- Significant complexity reduction through good abstractions

### Moderate Positive Score (+1 to +3)
- Extracting duplicated code into functions
- Adding clear interfaces for existing implementations
- Introducing helpful value objects/types
- Simplifying overly complex code

### Neutral Score (0)
- Renaming without structural change
- Minor refactoring with no abstraction change
- Equivalent complexity trade-offs

### Moderate Negative Score (-1 to -3)
- Premature abstraction (before duplication exists)
- Unnecessary wrapper classes
- Over-generic implementations
- Confusing or misnamed abstractions

### High Negative Score (-4 to -5)

## Red Flags for Over-Abstraction

- Abstract/Base/Factory/Provider/Manager in every name
- Interfaces with single implementation
- Generic types with complex parameter lists
- Deep inheritance hierarchies (4+ levels)
- Many files with <10 lines of code
- Builder pattern for simple objects
- Visitor pattern for non-polymorphic operations

## Green Flags for Good Abstraction

- Clear, domain-driven names
- Single, focused responsibility
- Abstracts recurring pattern (3+ occurrences)
- Reduces cyclomatic complexity
- Improves testability
- Follows language idioms
- Makes code more readable

## Final Output Format

Return a JSON object with:
```json
{
  "dimension": "abstraction",
  "score": <number between -5 and +5>,
  "reasoning": "<concise explanation>",
  "key_factors": ["<factor 1>", "<factor 2>", "..."],
  "abstraction_changes": {
    "added": ["<new abstraction 1>", "<new abstraction 2>"],
    "removed": ["<removed abstraction 1>"],
    "refined": ["<improved abstraction 1>"],
    "complexity_change": <estimated cyclomatic complexity change>
  },
  "confidence": "<high|medium|low>"
}
```

**The score is the most critical output** - it should reflect whether the abstractions added/removed make the codebase more or less maintainable and understandable.
