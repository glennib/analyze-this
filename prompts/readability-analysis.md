# Code Readability Analysis Prompt

## Objective
Analyze git diff changes to determine how they impact code readability and clarity. Produce a numerical score from **-5 to +5** that represents the change:
- **Negative scores (-5 to -1)**: Decreased readability (harder to understand)
- **Zero (0)**: No significant change in readability
- **Positive scores (+1 to +5)**: Increased readability (easier to understand)

## Philosophy

**Readable code is code that can be understood quickly and correctly by developers.**

Good readability means:
- Clear, descriptive names that reveal intent
- Simple, focused functions that do one thing
- Logical flow that's easy to follow
- Minimal cognitive overhead
- Self-documenting code structure

Poor readability means:
- Cryptic, abbreviated, or misleading names
- Complex, tangled logic
- Unclear flow and sequencing
- High cognitive load
- Code requiring extensive comments to understand

## Context
You will be provided with:
1. Git diff output showing added/removed/modified lines
2. File paths and code structure
3. Programming language context

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Naming Quality

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Evaluate Naming
Review all new/changed names:
- Are they descriptive?
- Do they reveal intent?
- Are they consistent?
- Could they be clearer?

### Step 2: Assess Function Quality
For each new/modified function:
- Is it focused and simple?
- Is the logic clear?
- Is it pure or has side effects?
- Is the flow easy to follow?

### Step 3: Examine Structure
Look at overall code structure:
- Is control flow clear?
- Are there unnecessary complexities?
- Is error handling obvious?
- Is organization logical?

### Step 4: Consider Cognitive Load
Evaluate mental overhead:
- How hard is this to understand?
- How much do you need to track?
- Are there surprises?
- Is it predictable?

### Step 5: Apply Scoring Rubric
- Sum improvements (positive points)
- Sum degradations (negative points)
- Weight by impact on readability
- Consider overall effect

### Step 6: Normalize to -5 to +5 Scale
- Cap at -5 (minimum)
- Cap at +5 (maximum)
- Round to nearest 0.5

### Step 7: Provide Justification
Include specific examples:
- Which names improved/worsened?
- Which functions became clearer/muddier?
- What structural changes affected readability?
- Overall readability impact

## Example Analysis Output

```json
{
  "score": 3.5,
  "reasoning": "Significantly improved readability through better naming and function extraction. Renamed variables from single letters (x, y, n) to descriptive names (userId, emailAddress, itemCount). Extracted complex validation logic into well-named helper functions (isValidEmail, hasRequiredPermissions). Reduced nesting depth from 4 to 2 levels using guard clauses.",
  "key_factors": [
    "12 variables renamed from cryptic to descriptive",
    "3 functions extracted with clear names",
    "Reduced nesting depth with guard clauses",
    "Improved boolean expression clarity"
  ]
}
```

## Example of Poor Readability

```json
{
  "score": -3.0,
  "reasoning": "Readability degraded through unclear naming and increased complexity. Renamed descriptive variables to single letters (user â†’ u, order â†’ o). Inlined several focused functions into one 120-line function with deep nesting. Added cryptic boolean expressions and removed helpful comments. Increased cyclomatic complexity from 8 to 25.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Cryptic single-letter variables introduced",
    "Multiple functions combined into 120-line monster",
    "Deep nesting (5 levels) with complex conditions",
    "Helpful comments removed",
    "Cyclomatic complexity increased 3x"
  ]
}
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Context matters**: Domain complexity affects readability standards
2. **Audience**: Consider team experience and conventions
3. **Language idioms**: What's readable varies by language
4. **Balance**: Sometimes brevity aids readability, sometimes it hurts
5. **Subjectivity**: Readability has subjective elements, but principles apply

## Common Patterns

### High Positive Score (+4 to +5)
- Major refactoring improving clarity throughout
- Renaming many unclear names to clear ones
- Breaking complex functions into simple, well-named pieces
- Significant reduction in cognitive overhead

### Moderate Positive Score (+1 to +3)
- Some improved naming
- Function extraction improving clarity
- Reduced nesting or complexity
- Better code organization

### Neutral Score (0)
- Code moves but readability unchanged
- Equivalent trade-offs
- Minor changes with no clear impact

### Moderate Negative Score (-1 to -3)
- Some unclear naming introduced
- Increased complexity or nesting
- Confusing logic added
- Poor code organization

### High Negative Score (-4 to -5)
- Widespread unclear naming
- Massive complex functions
- Deeply nested, hard-to-follow logic
- Code obfuscation or "clever" tricks

## Final Output Format

Return a JSON object with:
```json
{
  "dimension": "readability",
  "score": <number between -5 and +5>,
  "reasoning": "<concise explanation>",
  "key_factors": ["<factor 1>", "<factor 2>", "..."],
  "confidence": "<high|medium|low>"
}
```

**The score is the most critical output** - it should reflect whether the change makes code easier or harder to understand.
